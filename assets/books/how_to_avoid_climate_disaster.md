## Summary


## Chapter: Introduction: 51 Billion to Zero

* the world typically adds 51 Billion tonnes of greenhouse gases per year
* to stop warming, we need to get to Zero

Virtually every part of a modern lifestyle contributes to releasing greenhouse gases. If the world carries on like it is, Gates predicts that the effects of the charning climate will be catastrophic. Gates initially started from the angle of delivering affordable energy to the poor, but as he dove into the details, he realised that it also needed to be done without emitting any new greenhouse gases. It's not acceptable to demand from poorer nations to not use more energy, so the only way forward is to make the clean sources the cheapest option.

Gates also addresses his own 'absurdly high' carbon footprint, including flying private planes toparis climate conference. He believes that his other actions, like offsetting his family's aviation emissions will make up for it.

The book will follow five parts:
* why going to zero is necessary
* how to have an informed opinion about climate change
* why going to zero will be very hard
* why going to zero is possible
* what steps can we take now



## Chapter: Why zero?

* the earth is warming up due to the greenhouse gases
* we don't know exactly what the effects of the warming will be
* small change in average temperature can have very large effects

As we go about our lives, we produce greenhouse gases. These gases stay in the atmosphere for a long time on human scale (around 20% of CO2 emitted today will still be there in 10 000 years). The greenhouse gases increase the average temperature on earth.

We don't know exactly what effects the increase temperatures will have, but given the long half-life, the effects will be long term.

By Zero, Gates means "near net zero", as the scenario where we abandon all fossil fuels immediately is not possible, and we will need to rely on technologies actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

Small numbers make big difference: during the last ice age, the average temperature was only 6 degrees Celsius lower, and during the age of dinosaurs, likely only 4 degrees Celsium higher.

Greenhouse gases include CO2, but also other gases which are more potent at warming up the atmosphere, like methane which is 120 times more potent, but doesn't stay in the atmosphere for as long. So to simplify things, scientists came up with a single measure of "carbon dioxide equivalents", or CO2e for short.

Greenhouse gases work just like a car windshield on a sunny day. The heat from the sun gets trapped in the car, and the interior of the car gets much hotter than the exterior. Why does it get trapped - it entered through the windshield in the first place, so why doesn't it go out through it again? This is because the heat reflected back from the car interior is at a different frequency to the one incoming from the sun, and it's not able to pass the windshield back out.

All life on earth relies on this greenhouse effect - without it, most of the energy coming from the sun would be reflected back into space, and the earth would be cold. The problem stems from us emitting more and more greenhouse gases and tweaking the strenght of the effect.

We know that the earth is warming, it's about 1 degree Celsius higher than during the pre-industrial levels, and we can predict some broad trends, but we don't currently have a way to predict particular events, or even know exactly how much the planet will heat at a particular point in the future. We also know that not everywhere will be affected equally - some places will be hit much harder than others, hidden behind the 'average' temperature increase.

Gates argues for the rich countries as the place where a lot of mitigation needs to start, not only because that's where the bulk of the emissions have been done historically, but also because they are best suited to develop the necessary climate solutions in terms of funding, infrastructure and seizing the economic opportunity.

## Chapter: This will be hard

* greenhouses are emitted in various ways, many of which are not obvious at first sight
* to achieve a net zero, we need technologies that are better and cheaper than the existing ones

Greenhouse gases are much more pervasive than they appear at first sight. From your toothbrush, made of plastics made of fossil fuels, to the grains grown using a fertilizer which releases methane, to the beef on your burger (cows produce methane), to the transportation and the nearby power plant; they are everywhere.

Fossil fuels are cheap and abundant, and massive industries have grown around them. To achieve net zero, we will not need need breakthroughs in science and enngineering, but also a consensus about preventing a climate disaster being a priority, and the laws and regulations that follow that. And the existing energy systems will need to continue working and accomodate for increasingly energy-heavy lifestyles, while at the same time emitting less greenhouse gases.

To top things up, our timeline is probably shorter than any of the previous gigantic changes that we've gone through as a species.

## Chapter: Five things to ask in every climate conversation

Without the necessary context, it's often hard to make sense of the climate change discours. The author offers some tips on how to approch such situations.

First, translate the numbers into a percentage of the 51 billion ton reduction goal. Gates offers an example of a programme promising 17 million tons reduction. To know whether it's a significant change, just divide it by the total 51 billion tons, the current yearly total emissions.

Second, a comprehensive climate plan will need to address all of the sources of emissions:

* 31% - building things (steel, cement and plastic)
* 27% - electricity
* 19% - food production (plants, animals)
* 16% - transport
* 7% - heating and cooling

Thirdly, it's useful to have an idea of how much power people require. An average American household is in the order of kilowatts (1000 watts); a small town, megawatts (1000 kilowatts); a large city, gigwatts (1000 megawatts); a large country like the USA 1000 gigawatts.

Fourthly, different forms of energy production have vastly different space requirements. We call it power density, or the amount of energy (watt) we can produce from a unit of space (m2):

* wood & other biomass - 1 watt / m2
* wind - 1-2 watt/m2
* hydropower - 5-50 watt/m2
* solar - 5-20 watt/m2
* nuclear - 500-1000 watt/m2
* fossil fuels - 500-10,000 watt/m2

Finally, let's think about costs. The existing energy technologies are typically the cheapest. The added cost to use a lower emission alternative is called a Green Premium. Considering different ideas, it's important to look at whether the Green Premium is affordable to everyone. Unfortunately, we don't yet have alternatives for everything (for example cement), so it's not always easy to estimate the Green Premiums.

## Chapter: How we plug in

* making electricty is arguably the most important problem to tackle to reduce greenhouse gases emissions
* we're going to need a collection of various technologies working together to achieve a reduction
* each technology comes with unique advantages and disadvantages, and progress is being made on mitigating the latter
* 

Cheap & reliable electicity is a bedrock of modern life. Generating that electricity produces 27% of the world's greenhouse emissions.

While manufacturing emits more, the electricity production is arguably the most important to address, because it can be used to decarbonify other activities, and because over 860 million people are still missing access to reliable electricity today.

Two thirds of the electricity generated worldwide today is from fossil fuels:

* 36% coal
* 23% natural gas
* 16% hydropower
* 11% renewables
* 10% nuclear
* 3% oil
* 1% other

The electricity is remarkably cheap (the USA spends about 2% of its GDP on electricity), in big part because of how cheap fossil fuels have become. Most countries actively work on keeping their fossil fuels prices attractive.

How much would it cost to decarbonify electricty? For some places, like the USA and Europe, the cost appears to be reasonably low. Some studies estimate around 15% and 20% premium respectively. 

Unfortunately, other places don't have the favourable conditions for wind or solar. Africa and Asia are in the toughest spot. Bulding inexpensive coal plants appears to be the most economical decision for many countries in these regions.

A big hurdle to overcome is the intermittency. Solar and wind are intermittent, meaning that they don't produce the same amount of energy at all times. Obviously, when the sun goes down, the solar panels stop working. This can be solved by using batteries to store the energy, at an extra cost. With the current tech, the storage cost can easily be multiples of the cost of generating the electricity in the first place.

Additionally, there is seasonal variance. Because of the Earth's tilt, the amount of sunlight any place gets depends on the time of the year. The size of that effect depends on how far you are from the equator. The author gives the example of Seattle, which gets twice the amount of sun on the longest day than it does on the shortest. Now, imagine that you'd like to install solar panels to cover a town's needs. If you install just enough for the summer, the town won't have enough in winter. If you install enough for winter, you will overproduce in the summer.

"Transporting" electricity is also hard. Transmission lines are expensive and require a massive investment to modernise. And the USA doesn't have a single, unified grid - instead, a collection of regional grids.

It's hard to conceive of a scenario of decarbonising the electricty production without nuclear fission reactors. The high-profile catastrophies like Three Mile Island, Chernobyl or Fukushima are well-know, but statistically nuclear power kills fewer people than any fossil fuel. New designs and companies are working on making nuclear fission safer, including Gates' own TerraPower.

Nuclear fusion, relying on atoms of hydrogens merging into helium in high temperatures, just like it occurs naturally in the sun. Nuclear fusion holds a lot of premise - the fuel is abundant and cheap, there is no risk of runaway reaction and the radioactive waste is much more easily manageable. However, it's proving hard to engineer in practice, hence the joke about how it's 40 years away, and will always be. None of the currently built reactors produce more power than they consume, they're research devices. ITER in France is hoping to generate excess power in late 2030s.

Offshore wind is another noteworthy technology, allowing for energy production closer to large cities, and benefitting from more consistent off-shore winds. At the moment it produces a miniscule fraction of USA's overall production (0.003%), but in theory could produce all of it if deployed widely. Getting it approved remains a major challenge, including a labirynth of permits.

Geothermal also holds some promise. It relies on pumping water underground to use the heat in the rocks hundreds to thousands of feet under the surface, and can reuse some of the technologies built for fossil fuels. It has been calculated, however, that in the UK, even if we deployed thermal to every square feet of the country, it wouldn't cover the country's usage.

The chapter also briefly discusses energy storage. Gates mentions that improving on lithium-iron batteries is proving more difficult than expected - he thinks that they can be improved by a factor of 3, but not 50. He's also lost money on battery-related startups. 

Another way of storing energy is pumped hydro, where water is pumped into a reservoir, and later release to produce electricity at desired time. The top 10 hydro facilities in the USA store less than one hour's worh of country's electricity needs at the moment.

Thermal storage offers another alternative. It relies on materials that can keep the heat without losing too much of it over time, like molten salts. It can offer 50-60% efficiency, which is not too bad.

Hydrogen can also be used to store energy that can be turned into electricity at the desired time. Storing hydrogen has its own issues (needs to be pressured for space efficiency, hydrogen slowly leaks through metal containers), but if we used clean electricity to produce hydrogen (electrolysis), and we decreased the cost of doing so, it could provide a valuable form of storage.

The chapter discusses capturing carbon. Point capture focuses on where the CO2 is produced (e.g. at the existing fossil fuel plants). An advantage of that approach is the high concentration of CO2 in the air(often around 10%). Direct carbon capture (DAC) focuses instead on capturing carbon from the air anywhere in the world, but it's made more challenging by the fact that on average only 1 in 2,500 molecules in the atmosphere are actually CO2.

As a final note, Gates discusses how his own opinion on using less has shifted to more favourable, once he realised just how much land would be required to meet the raising electricity demands with solar and wind power alone.

## Chapter: How we make things

* materials like steel, concrete, glass & plastics are important to modern lifestyles
* producing them releases CO2 into the atmosphere
* some materials, like concrete, are harder to turn carbon-neutral than others
* electrification relying on clean electricity production can help

When you look at various signs of improving lifestyles, you see a lot of man-made materials. Skyscrapers are full of concrete, steel & glass. Cars & electronics contain plenty of plastics. These materials are extremely successful, but the way we produce them at the moment releases a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Steel is made of iron and carbon, and is both strong and easy to bend while hot. The form of iron that you dig out of the ground (iron ore) is polluted with other elements. To make steel, you melt the iron ore at high temperature in the presence of oxygen & carbon. The byproduct is CO2 - 1.8 tons of CO2 for every 1 ton of steel produced. The world is expected to produce about 5 billion tons of CO2 yearly from steel production by 2050.

Concrete production offers a similar story. To make concrete, you use cement. To make cement, you use calcium. To get calcium, you burn limestone, and produce 1 ton of CO2 for every ton of calcium. This contributes another 4 billion tons per year at the moment, and currently there is no known way to produce cement without releasing CO2.

Plastics, specifically synthetic plastics, are made of carbon mixed with other elements like hydrogen and oxygen. The carbon is typically taken from a fossil fuel, and while the good news is that instead of going into the atmosphere, a large proportion of the carbon ends up in the end material; the bad news is that the carbon bonds are very durable, and the plastics we produce can take hundreds of years to degrade, ending up with all kinds of problems from poisoning marine life, to filling up landfills for centuries.

To address the emissions linked to these materials, you need to look at all the stages involved:

* electricity needed to run the factories & equipment
* the way to generate the heat needed
* the side products of actually making the materials in question

The first problem is the one of clean electricity, discusses in previous chapter. The second one requires high temperatures that typically require either burning a fossil fuel or nuclear energy. Capturing back some of the CO2 produced can help. The third problem is the hardest, and we don't have a solution in some cases. We can offset some of that with more carbon capture.

Added all together, the green premiums (extra cost to make the process greenhouse gas-netural) end up being 75-140% for cement, 16-29% for steel and 9-15% for plastics.

How can we get these to be lower? Use clean electricity, and electrify the existing process as much as possible. For example, a new process called molten oxide electrolysis can purify the iron needed for steel production without requiring high temperatures currently achieved through burning fossil fuels.

And given that plastics contain a lot of carbon, they have the hypthetical potential to become carbon sinks - if we could capture it from other processes.
