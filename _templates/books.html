How many times a day do you come to realize that you won't be able to read all of the amazing books out there in your entire lifetime? ðŸ“š It hits me at least once a day.
But why read only a fraction of them fully, when you can have a good idea of what they're all about? (I mean, not all of them, but like, we try). We extracted the juiciest bits to save you time and effort.ðŸ§ƒ 
We also made sure to keep the science - just minus some of the fancy words to make our lives easier.
